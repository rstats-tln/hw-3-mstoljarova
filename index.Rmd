```

### Exercises

Loading required libraries:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

Importing dataset:
```{r}
viruses <- read_csv(here("data", "viruses.csv"))
```

Print out dataset:
```{r}
viruses
```


1. Find all viruses that:

- have genome of over 10000kb

```{r}
filter(viruses, size_kb > 10000)
```

- belong to *Papillomaviridae*

```{r}
filter(viruses, subgroup == "Papillomaviridae" )
```

- are from plants and environment

```{r}
filter(viruses, host == "plants" | host == "environment")
```

```{r}
filter(viruses, host %in% c("plants", "environment"))
```



- were released between 01. January 1980 - 01. January 1990, including these days:

```{r}
filter(viruses, release_date >= "1980-01-01", release_date <= "1990-01-01")
```

2. there is also between() function in dplyr. 

What does it do? Run ?between
How can you use it to find viruses with genomes between 1 to 2 kb?

```{r}
?between
```

```{r}
size_kb <- viruses$size_kb
```

```{r}
between(size_kb, 1, 2)
```

```{r}
between(viruses$size_kb, 1, 2)
```

```{r}
filter(viruses, between(viruses$size_kb, 1, 2))
```
MS: this one worked!!!


3. Find Enteroviruses:

Hint: use str_detect()
```{r}
filter( viruses, str_detect(organism_name, "nterovirus" ))
```
